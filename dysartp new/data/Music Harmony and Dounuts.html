					  	<p><t>A monograph on conventional triadic harmony and scales unique in its approach to the subject through its persistent use of graphical

						<p>Although the discussion might seem academic, it is instead just anotherway to think about music harmony and scales. There's really nothing new in substance, only in its presentation which relies entirely on pictures and graphs. The presentation is structured like many other self-instruction books on music harmony with chapters on intervals, scales, chords, and harmonic progression. However in this case, the Tonnetz is used to graphically explore these and other musical elements such as prime scales, tonic centers, and modes without the use of conventional music notation. The absence of any music notation is by design, since it is fundamentally an attempt to describe music harmony via a new - but very old - visual system. </p>

						<p>Music theory and self-instruction books commonly use a graphical device known as the circle-of-fifths. The circle-of-fifths arranges the notes of the chromatic scale on a circle in a sequence of fifth intervals that repeats after 12 notes. The circle-of-fifths is widespread in its use as a graphical aid in the presentation of musical concepts, and for many the circle-of-fifths is particularly appealing due to its presentation in the form of a simple geometric shape.</p>
						<p>The use of simple graphical objects such as lines and circles to illustrate theories and concepts is a common and effective teaching strategy. The circle-of-fifths has been used in this way to visualize many musical abstractions. However, the circle-of-fifths is only one of several possible slices through a 2-dimensional surface first described long ago in the music literature as the tonnetz. The underlying shape of the tonnetz as recognized later by others is a torus - the shape of a donut. Although it's true that a circle is a cross section of other surfaces such a sphere or a cone, it is the torus that contains the circle-of-fifths and all the other intervals too. This musical donut has been used over the years to support musical developments of the most abstract kind <sup>1</sup>. However, as a framework for displaying shapes and patterns, it can also be used to illustrate many common musical concepts, and help one visualize relationships that are often difficult to see on the grand stave. In the following, the tonnetz and its variants are used to explore the geometry of music in a way that can help illuminate the space through which music travels.</p> <br>

					  	<p>The tonnetz, a German phrase meaning 'harmonic network', has appeared in many forms since it was first used by the eighteenth century German mathematician Leonard Euler <sup>2</sup>. An early version of the tonnetz developed by Riemann is shown in Figure 1-1, and a similar representation appeared as a table in the work of Oettingen <sup>3</sup>.</p>
						<p>Music theory and self-instruction books commonly use a graphical device known as the circle-of-fifths. The circle-of-fifths is simply an arrangement of the notes of the chromatic scale on a circle in a sequence of fifth intervals that repeats after 12 notes. The circle-of-fifths is widespread in its use as a graphical aid in the presentation of musical concepts, and for many the circle-of-fifths is particularly appealing due to its presentation in the form of a simple geometric shape.</p>
						<p>The traditional form of the tonnetz similar to the one show in Figure 1-1 can be assembled in just a few steps by arranging the 12 notes of the chromatic scale on a 2-dimensional grid of rows and columns beginning with the circle-of-fifths.&nbsp;This is illustrated in Figure 1-2 where the circle-of-fifths is first disconnected and laid out in a straight line. The first row of fifth intervals could have started with any note as long as all 12 notes are included <sup>4</sup>. In the next step, the same row of fifths is shifted and placed below and between the notes in the first row so the notes are a minor third apart. This pattern is repeated again below the second and third rows. It soon becomes apparent that the columns are moving down by half steps, so the columns can be filled-in with the remaining notes, and the result is the traditional form of the tonnetz.</p>

					  	<p>The tonnetz was first seen as a flat plane that extended infinitely in all directions. However, it was Lubin that first recognized that this arrangement of notes could be formed into the surface of a torus <sup>5</sup>. This can be seen in <a href="file:///Users/karlcd/Desktop/dysartp%20new/1-2.html" target="_blank">Figure 1-2</a> where the last note at the bottom of each column of half steps, like the disconnected row of fifths, picks-up where the first note at the top of the column left off. This suggested that the rows and the columns could be connected into circles.</p>
					  	<p>To see this more clearly, imagine that the grid is drawn on a sheet of rubber that can be rolled and stretched as shown in Figure 1-3. By rolling the sheet into a cylindrical tube and connecting the columns, the half-step columns now go around the tube in continuous circles. The M3 and m3 intervals can also be traced around the tube, but they follow a spiral path that still runs off at the ends. The rows of fifth intervals also run off at the ends, so the final step shown in Figure 1-3 is to connect the ends of the tube together by stretching and bending the tube into the shape of a donut. This connects the rows of fifth intervals into continuous circles again, and also connects the M3 and m3 intervals into spirals that now trace a continuous path around the donut.</p>
